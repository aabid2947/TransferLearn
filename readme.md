# Transfer Learning Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of transfer learning using PyTorch. Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models to solve new problems with minimal training, significantly reducing computational resources and time.

## Features
- Utilizes PyTorch and Torchvision for seamless model integration.
- Includes data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Implements custom dataloaders and training pipelines.
- Demonstrates training a pre-trained model on custom datasets.
- Evaluates model performance with visualizations.

## Project Overview
The project comprises the following steps:
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensures compatibility with updated PyTorch versions (1.12+).
2. **Dataset Preparation**: Downloads and organizes training and testing datasets.
3. **Data Transformation**: Applies preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
4. **Model Definition**: Configures a pre-trained model for transfer learning.
5. **Training and Optimization**: Trains the model and optimizes hyperparameters.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluates model accuracy and generates results visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of pizzas, steaks, and sushi, sourced from a GitHub repository. The dataset is automatically downloaded and extracted by the notebook during execution. A modular approach is used to handle dataset preparation and integration seamlessly:

```
        request = requests.get("https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/raw/main/data/pizza_steak_sushi.zip")
        print("Downloading pizza, steak, sushi data...")
        f.write(request.content)

    # Unzip data
    with zipfile.ZipFile(data_path / "pizza_steak_sushi.zip", "r") as zip_ref:
        print("Unzipping pizza, steak, sushi data...")
        zip_ref.extractall(image_path)

```

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.12+  
- Torchvision 0.13+  
- Additional libraries: `matplotlib`, `requests`

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib requests
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

3. Run the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TransferLearning.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps within the notebook for end-to-end implementation.

## Results
The notebook concludes with visualizations of the model's performance and test results. These include accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and sample predictions.
